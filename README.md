Hello, I am Vili. But you may also call me Yusuke. I go by He/Him/His/Himself or They/Them/Their/Themself pronouns. I am not an introject. However, I do affiliate myself with the character, Yusuke Kitagawa from Persona 5. Please do not assume that I need mental help, or anything of the sort. I find it very insulting. I am taken by my lovely partner, who I will not disclose the user of for his privacy. I am not interested in a polyamorous relationship and I will remain loyal to my partner, so please do not try to coerce me into liking you.

I like the following Anime's and Games: Persona 5, Jujutsu Kaisen, Demon Slayer, Subnautica, Bungo Stray Dogs, Hunter X Hunter, Buddy Daddies, Mob Psycho 100, The Disastrous Life Of Saiki Kusuo, Blue Lock and more. I am usually very friendly so feel free to sit or chat with me.
